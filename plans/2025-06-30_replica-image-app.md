# Replicate Image App - Development Plan

**Date:** June 30, 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Branch:** `feature/replicate-image-app`

## Overview

This plan outlines the development of a replicated image application, focusing on implementing core image processing and manipulation features.

## Project Goals

- Create a comprehensive image processing application
- Implement modern web technologies for optimal performance
- Ensure responsive design across all devices
- Maintain high code quality and testing standards

## Technical Stack

Based on the current project structure:
- **Frontend:** React/TypeScript with Vite
- **Styling:** Modern CSS/SCSS
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Package Management:** npm
- **Deployment:** Cloudflare Workers (based on wrangler.json)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning
- [x] Create feature branch `feature/replicate-image-app`
- [x] Document development plan
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [x] Configure CI/CD pipeline (handled by Cloudflare webhook)

### Phase 2: Core Image Processing Features
- [ ] Implement basic image upload functionality
- [ ] Add image format conversion capabilities
- [ ] Develop image resizing and cropping tools
- [ ] Create image filters and effects system

### Phase 3: User Interface Development
- [ ] Design responsive layout
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop interface
- [ ] Create image preview and editing panels
- [ ] Add progress indicators and loading states

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Batch processing capabilities
- [ ] Image optimization algorithms
- [ ] Export functionality with multiple formats
- [ ] History/undo system

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for UI components
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

### Phase 6: Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] User guide creation
- [ ] Production deployment setup
- [ ] Monitoring and analytics

## Key Considerations

### Performance
- Optimize image processing algorithms
- Implement lazy loading for large images
- Use web workers for heavy computations
- Minimize bundle size

### User Experience
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Real-time preview of changes
- Clear error messaging
- Responsive design for mobile devices

### Security
- Validate file uploads
- Sanitize user inputs
- Implement rate limiting
- Secure API endpoints

## Success Metrics

- Image processing speed < 2 seconds for standard operations
- Support for major image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, SVG)
- Mobile-responsive design (works on screens 320px+)
- 95%+ unit test coverage
- Lighthouse performance score > 90

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- Browser compatibility for advanced image processing
- Memory limitations with large image files
- Performance bottlenecks in processing pipeline

### Mitigation Strategies
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Implement file size limits and warnings
- Use web workers for CPU-intensive tasks
- Comprehensive testing across browsers

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** Project setup and core infrastructure
- **Week 3-4:** Basic image processing implementation
- **Week 5-6:** UI development and user experience
- **Week 7-8:** Advanced features and optimization
- **Week 9-10:** Testing, documentation, and deployment

## Team Collaboration

This plan serves as a living document for team discussion and refinement. All team members are encouraged to:
- Review and provide feedback on technical approach
